Summary of the project:

I have divided project into four modules

1) selenium-domain (Not used currently)
2) selenium-framework (Includes all the selenium dependencies and helper methods)
3) selenium-pageobjects (Includes page classes for booking.com webpages)
4) selenium-tests(Includes script for testing Booking.com webpage)

testng.xml : Test can be run using this file. It includes test classes and parameters needed to run the tests.

NOTE : In the test right now I am not doing any validation. It is just a script to
a) Search for hotels in Los Angeles
b) Select a random hotel from the top 3 results
c) Book the room with lowest price
d) Go to the checkout page
